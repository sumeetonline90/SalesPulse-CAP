### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Now Implemented:
```
Browser ‚Üí Application Router (UI App) ‚Üí Backend Service (SRV App)

    Single Origin (No CORS Issues)
         ‚Üì
    Proper Authentication & Routing
```

### üêõ Errors Encountered and Solutions:

#### Error 1: "Not Found" Error on UI Access
- **Problem**: Application Router `welcomeFile` was set to `"webapp/index.html"` but routes served from `webapp` directory
- **Solution**: Changed `welcomeFile` to `"index.html"` in `app/salespulse-ui/xs-app.json`
- **Result**: UI application now loads correctly at root URL

#### Error 2: Page Refresh After Upload
- **Problem**: FileUploader was configured with `uploadUrl` and `uploadComplete`, causing form submission and page refresh
- **Solution**: Removed built-in upload properties and handled upload purely via JavaScript
- **Result**: Upload now works without page refresh

#### Error 3: Data Not Refreshing After Upload
- **Problem**: Table wasn't properly refreshing to show new data after upload
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive refresh logic with immediate table clearing and delayed model refresh
- **Result**: Old data is properly replaced with new upload data

#### Error 4: JavaScript TypeError on Upload Button
- **Problem**: `TypeError: oEvent.stopPropagation is not a function` when clicking upload button
- **Solution**: Added proper null checks for event methods before calling them
- **Result**: Upload button now works without JavaScript errors

#### Error 5: OData Model Refresh Error
- **Problem**: `Error: Unsupported parameter bForceUpdate` when refreshing sales data
- **Solution**: Removed unsupported parameters from `oModel.refresh()` and `binding.refresh()` calls
- **Result**: Data refresh now works correctly without errors

#### Error 6: Service Path Mismatch (404 Error)
- **Problem**: UI trying to access `/sales-service/SalesOrders` but backend serves at `/odata/v4/sales-service`
- **Solution**: Fixed manifest.json URI to use correct OData V4 path `/odata/v4/sales-service/`
- **Result**: OData model can now properly load metadata and bind to SalesOrders entity

#### Error 7: Persistent Build Caching Issues
- **Problem**: MTA build process kept reverting manifest.json and Component-preload.js to old URI `/sales-service/` despite source files being correct
- **Solution**: Implemented post-build correction process - manually fix built files after MTA build completes
- **Result**: Application successfully deployed with correct OData V4 service paths

#### Error 8: Unwanted "No Data Found" Message
- **Problem**: After successful data upload and display, an unwanted message "sales data refreshed - no data found" was appearing
- **Solution**: Simplified the refreshSalesData method by removing unnecessary context checking and message display
- **Result**: Clean user experience with data displayed without confusing messages

#### Error 9: Data Persistence and CRUD Requirements
- **Problem**: Need to implement persistent data storage, CRUD operations, duplicate handling, and geography charts
- **Solution**: Enhanced backend service with duplicate detection, added CRUD operations, implemented geography data aggregation, and created interactive UI with charts
- **Result**: Full-featured application with persistent data, complete CRUD functionality, and visual analytics

#### Error 10: CRUD Operations Not Working After First Use
- **Problem**: Update order function not working, create entry not responding after update, geography chart not showing data, CRUD operations breaking after first operation
- **Solution**: Implemented proper OData V4 CRUD operations following official odata.org standards - POST for create, PATCH for update, DELETE for delete, proper URL patterns with entity keys, enhanced error handling, and dialog cleanup
- **Result**: All CRUD operations now work reliably without breaking after first use, geography chart displays data correctly, and application maintains full functionality across all operations
