# SalesPulse CAP Application - Progress Status

## Current Status (September 7, 2025)

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **Local Development**: Excel upload functionality works perfectly locally
2. **xlsx Module**: Properly installed and included in production build
3. **Backend Service**: Running successfully on BTP
4. **UI Application**: Deployed and accessible on BTP
5. **Git Repository**: All code changes committed and pushed

### ‚ùå Current Issue:
**CORS Error on BTP Deployment**
- Error: `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource`
- Frontend (UI) trying to access backend service from different origin
- CORS headers added to backend service but not working in production

### üîß What Was Attempted:
1. Added CORS headers to `srv/service.js`
2. Switched to staticfile buildpack
3. Updated frontend to use direct backend URLs
4. Verified xlsx module is included in production build

### üìã Next Steps (When You Return):

#### Option 1: Fix CORS Headers in Production
1. Check if CORS headers are being applied in BTP deployment
2. Verify backend service logs for CORS header presence
3. Test CORS headers with direct backend service calls

#### Option 2: Implement Application Router Pattern (Recommended)
1. Switch back to Application Router (`@sap/approuter`)
2. Configure proper routing in `xs-app.json`
3. Use relative URLs in frontend (no CORS issues)
4. Let Application Router handle authentication and routing

#### Option 3: Alternative CORS Solution
1. Configure CORS at the Cloud Foundry level
2. Use environment variables for CORS configuration
3. Implement CORS middleware at the Express level

### üéØ Recommended Approach:
**Use Application Router Pattern** - This is the standard SAP BTP approach and eliminates CORS issues entirely by having the frontend and backend communicate through the same origin.

### üìÅ Files Modified:
- `srv/service.js` - Added CORS headers
- `app/salespulse-ui/webapp/controller/Main.controller.js` - Direct backend URLs
- `app/salespulse-ui/webapp/manifest.json` - Backend service URL
- `mta.yaml` - Staticfile buildpack configuration
- `package.json` - Added xlsx module
- `app/salespulse-ui/Staticfile` - Staticfile configuration

### üîó Application URLs:
- **UI**: https://innovalaisandbox-sandbox-salespulse-cap-ui.cfapps.in30.hana.ondemand.com/
- **Backend**: https://innovalaisandbox-sandbox-salespulse-cap-srv.cfapps.in30.hana.ondemand.com/sales-service/
- **Git Repository**: https://github.com/sumeetonline90/SalesPulse-CAP

### üí° Key Insight:
The Excel upload functionality works perfectly locally, proving that the xlsx module and backend logic are correct. The issue is purely a CORS configuration problem in the BTP deployment environment.
