### üîß What Was Accomplished Today:

#### 1. Complete Application Router Implementation
- ‚úÖ Refactored `mta.yaml` to use `approuter.nodejs` module type
- ‚úÖ Created proper `package.json` for App Router with `@sap/approuter@20.7.1`
- ‚úÖ Configured proper routing in `xs-app.json` files
- ‚úÖ Removed obsolete `Staticfile` configuration
- ‚úÖ Successfully deployed with `nodejs_buildpack`

#### 2. Backend Service Configuration
- ‚úÖ Updated `srv/service.cds` to serve at `/odata/v4/sales-service`
- ‚úÖ Removed manual CORS headers (no longer needed)
- ‚úÖ Verified service is running at correct OData V4 endpoint
- ‚úÖ Confirmed authentication is working (401 responses as expected)

#### 3. Frontend Configuration Updates
- ‚úÖ Updated `manifest.json` to use `/odata/v4/sales-service/`
- ‚úÖ Modified `Main.controller.js` to use relative URLs for CSRF and upload
- ‚úÖ Updated `Main.view.xml` FileUploader to use correct OData V4 path
- ‚úÖ Configured `xs-app.json` routing for `/odata/v4/sales-service/*`

#### 4. Clean Deployment Process
- ‚úÖ Deleted all existing apps and services for fresh deployment
- ‚úÖ Built complete MTAR using `mbt build` command
- ‚úÖ Deployed fresh MTA with proper service bindings
- ‚úÖ Verified all apps are running with correct buildpacks

#### 5. Service Configuration
- ‚úÖ XSUAA service properly bound to both UI and backend
- ‚úÖ HANA Cloud database deployed and connected
- ‚úÖ All service bindings working correctly

#### 6. Excel Upload Data Refresh Issues - RESOLVED
- ‚úÖ Fixed "Not Found" error by correcting `welcomeFile` path in `xs-app.json`
- ‚úÖ Resolved page refresh issue after upload by removing FileUploader's built-in upload
- ‚úÖ Implemented proper data refresh logic to replace old data with new uploads
- ‚úÖ Added immediate table clearing and delayed refresh for better UX
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling and user feedback messages

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Now Implemented:
```
Browser ‚Üí Application Router (UI App) ‚Üí Backend Service (SRV App)
         ‚Üì
    Single Origin (No CORS Issues)
         ‚Üì
    Proper Authentication & Routing
```

### üêõ Errors Encountered and Solutions:

#### Error 1: "Not Found" Error on UI Access
- **Problem**: Application Router `welcomeFile` was set to `"webapp/index.html"` but routes served from `webapp` directory
- **Solution**: Changed `welcomeFile` to `"index.html"` in `app/salespulse-ui/xs-app.json`
- **Result**: UI application now loads correctly at root URL

#### Error 2: Page Refresh After Upload
- **Problem**: FileUploader was configured with `uploadUrl` and `uploadComplete`, causing form submission and page refresh
- **Solution**: Removed built-in upload properties and handled upload purely via JavaScript
- **Result**: Upload now works without page refresh

#### Error 3: Data Not Refreshing After Upload
- **Problem**: Table wasn't properly refreshing to show new data after upload
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive refresh logic with immediate table clearing and delayed model refresh
- **Result**: Old data is properly replaced with new upload data

#### Error 4: JavaScript TypeError on Upload Button
- **Problem**: `TypeError: oEvent.stopPropagation is not a function` when clicking upload button
- **Solution**: Added proper null checks for event methods before calling them
- **Result**: Upload button now works without JavaScript errors

#### Error 5: OData Model Refresh Error
- **Problem**: `Error: Unsupported parameter bForceUpdate` when refreshing sales data
- **Solution**: Removed unsupported parameters from `oModel.refresh()` and `binding.refresh()` calls
- **Result**: Data refresh now works correctly without errors

#### Error 6: Service Path Mismatch (404 Error)
- **Problem**: UI trying to access `/sales-service/SalesOrders` but backend serves at `/odata/v4/sales-service`
- **Solution**: Fixed manifest.json URI to use correct OData V4 path `/odata/v4/sales-service/`
- **Result**: OData model can now properly load metadata and bind to SalesOrders entity

#### Error 7: Persistent Build Caching Issues
- **Problem**: MTA build process kept reverting manifest.json and Component-preload.js to old URI `/sales-service/` despite source files being correct
- **Solution**: Implemented post-build correction process - manually fix built files after MTA build completes
- **Result**: Application successfully deployed with correct OData V4 service paths

#### Error 8: Unwanted "No Data Found" Message
- **Problem**: After successful data upload and display, an unwanted message "sales data refreshed - no data found" was appearing
- **Solution**: Simplified the refreshSalesData method by removing unnecessary context checking and message display
- **Result**: Clean user experience with data displayed without confusing messages

### üìÅ Files Modified Today:
- `mta.yaml` - Changed UI module to `approuter.nodejs`
- `app/salespulse-ui/package.json` - Added App Router dependency and start script
- `app/salespulse-ui/xs-app.json` - Configured routing for OData V4 paths and fixed welcomeFile
- `app/salespulse-ui/webapp/xs-app.json` - Updated routing configuration
- `app/salespulse-ui/webapp/manifest.json` - Updated to OData V4 service URI
- `app/salespulse-ui/webapp/controller/Main.controller.js` - Enhanced upload logic and data refresh, removed unwanted messages
- `app/salespulse-ui/webapp/view/Main.view.xml` - Removed FileUploader built-in upload properties
- `srv/service.cds` - Changed service path to `/odata/v4/sales-service`
- `srv/service.js` - Removed manual CORS headers
- `app/salespulse-ui/Staticfile` - Deleted (obsolete)
